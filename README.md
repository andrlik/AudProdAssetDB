## Planned Features

- Indexes assets such as licensed music, SFX, etc. into a searchable database.
- Assign tags to assets and any credits required, as well as recording license sourcing for your freelance work.
- Mark assets as used for a given episode and then export show-note credits by episode.
- Optionally sync data to companion web-service for both backups and integration with invoicing tools.
